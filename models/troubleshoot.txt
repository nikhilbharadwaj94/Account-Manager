>>When i created the customer table i was able to inset only 1 record
when i tried to insert another record i was getting the error-
errmsg: 'E11000 duplicate key error collection: DBManager.customers index: username_1 dup key: { : null }',

When i searched online i found that the problem was with the passport-local-mongoose plugin.
when i commented the plugin line it worked normally for me. How can i overcome the problem without commenting
that statement?
